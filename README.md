# Sentiments-Toward-Energy-Sources-and-Sustainable-Technologies
## Introduction
The energy industry is changing world wide. The majority of these changes surround the way electricity is generated, distributed, and used. There are many benefits to these changes from consumers to industry alike. That begs the question, have sentiments toward these changes and technologies changed in the past decade? This project aims to gauge user sentiments on twitter over a ten year span.

## Technologies
This project makes use of Python (in both .py and .ipynb) and Mongo DB.

## Getting Started

Users must have python 3.811=< installed on their machines, as well as Jupyter, and MongoDB Compass. Users must also have pymongoo, pandas, and plotly packages installed.

The provided scripts are set up to be ran in the order of Scrape All.py, Append Sentimnentpy, and Visualization loop.py. These scripts will scrape data from twitter and load them into Mongo DB. This process can be extremely timely. A backup of my database has been uploaded here for download: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11B0XRIL5H3Y6tPLkuqk78Z_mTi7s6Q6y?usp=sharing.
